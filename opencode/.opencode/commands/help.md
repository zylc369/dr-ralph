# Dr. Ralph Plugin Help

Please explain the following to the user:

## What is Dr. Ralph?

Dr. Ralph is an AI-assisted medical diagnostic plugin that provides a structured 5-phase workflow for comprehensive symptom analysis and treatment planning.

**The 5 Phases:**
1. **Interview** - Medical records intake, then comprehensive symptom questions
2. **Research** - Web search for literature and treatment protocols
3. **Differential** - Confidence-based diagnosis analysis
4. **Treatment** - Research-backed action plan with urgency levels
5. **Report** - SOAP format documentation

Dr. Ralph maintains patient notes across sessions and generates professional medical reports.

## Available Commands

**Usage:**
```
/dr-ralph:diagnose "I've been having back pain for 3 months" --patient "John Doe"
