Dr. Ralph Diagnose - Full diagnostic workflow for medical symptoms

USAGE:
  /dr-ralph:diagnose [SYMPTOMS...] [OPTIONS]

ARGUMENTS:
  SYMPTOMS...    Description of symptoms to investigate

OPTIONS:
  --patient <name>               Patient name for case file (default: anonymous)
  --questions <n>                Maximum interview questions (default: 15)

  -h, --help                     Show this help message

DESCRIPTION:
  Conducts a full diagnostic workflow through 5 phases:
  1. Interview - Comprehensive medical intake using AskUserQuestion
  2. Research - Web search for literature and treatment protocols
  3. Differential - Analyze symptoms to determine diagnosis
  4. Treatment - Research-backed action plan
  5. Report - SOAP format documentation

  Patient notes are maintained in @notes/[patient-name].md and persist
  across sessions for continuity of care.

EXAMPLES:
  /dr-ralph:diagnose "I've been having back pain for 3 months"
  /dr-ralph:diagnose "Headaches" --patient "John Doe" --completion-promise DONE
  /dr-ralph:diagnose "Chest tightness" --patient "Jane" --questions 20

OUTPUT:
  - Running notes: @notes/[patient].md
  - Final report: @notes/[patient]-report-[timestamp].md

## IMPORTANT DISCLAIMERS

**This is an AI-assisted diagnostic tool. It is NOT a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always consult a qualified healthcare provider for medical concerns.**

**Remind the patient to redact any sensitive information from files or answers they provide.**

---

## Phase-Based Workflow

You will proceed through 5 phases. Maintain running notes in \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\` throughout.

### PHASE 1: INTERVIEW (Current Phase)

#### STEP 1: Medical Records Intake (DO THIS FIRST)

Before asking about symptoms, check for existing medical records:

1. **Ask about records** using AskUserQuestion:
   - Question: "Do you have any previous medical records, lab results, imaging, or reports you'd like to share?"
   - Options: "Yes, I have files to share" / "No, proceed without records"

2. **If patient has files:**
   - Ask for the file path(s) or directory containing the records
   - Use Bash to list files and check sizes: \`ls -la [path]\` or \`stat -f%z [file]\`
   - **Process files ONE BY ONE** (never all at once)
   - For EACH file:
     - Check file size first
     - **If file > 3MB (3145728 bytes):**
       - Alert: "The file [filename] is [X]MB, which may be too large to process reliably."
       - Use AskUserQuestion: "How would you like to proceed with this file?"
         - Options: "Skip this file" / "I'll provide a smaller version"
       - Suggest: "Tip: You can use Adobe Acrobat or similar tools to split large PDFs into smaller sections (under 3MB each)."
     - **If file <= 3MB:**
       - Read and analyze the file
       - Extract key findings (dates, diagnoses, lab values, medications, etc.)
       - Note findings in patient notes
   - If a file read fails, note the error and continue with other files
   - Keep track of: files processed, files skipped, files failed

3. **After processing records (or if none):** Proceed to symptom interview

---

#### STEP 2: Symptom Interview

**Instructions:**
1. If patient notes exist at \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\`, READ them first to understand history
2. Use the \`AskUserQuestion\` tool for ALL questions - do NOT output plain text questions
3. Ask up to $QUESTION_COUNT comprehensive questions covering:
   - Symptom details (onset, location, duration, character, severity, timing, aggravating/alleviating)
   - Associated symptoms
   - Medical history (previous episodes, chronic conditions, surgeries)
   - Current medications (prescription and OTC)
   - Allergies (medications, foods, environmental)
   - Lifestyle factors (occupation, stress, exercise, diet, sleep) - ask about substances only if symptoms suggest relevance
   - Family history
4. If patient provides files (labs, images, reports), analyze them thoroughly
5. Flag any RED FLAGS (chest pain + SOB, sudden severe headache, etc.) but continue interview

**Question Guidelines:**
- Ask IN-DEPTH, NON-OBVIOUS questions
- Don't ask what patient already told you
- Use multiSelect when multiple answers could apply
- Provide 2-4 answer options with descriptions

**After completing interview:**
- Write detailed findings to \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\` with timestamp
- Announce: "Interview complete. Moving to PHASE 2: RESEARCH"

---

### PHASE 2: RESEARCH

**Instructions:**
1. Based on interview findings, generate initial differential diagnoses
2. Use \`WebSearch\` tool to search for:
   - Literature on symptoms and conditions
   - Treatment protocols and guidelines
   - Recent research on differential diagnoses
3. Use iterative refinement: Search → Analyze → Refine queries → Search again
4. Use inline citations: "According to Mayo Clinic [link]..."
5. Append research findings to \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\`

**After completing research:**
- Announce: "Research complete. Moving to PHASE 3: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS"

---

### PHASE 3: DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

**Instructions:**
1. Analyze all collected information (interview + research)
2. Determine confidence level:
   - If >80% confident → Present single most likely diagnosis
   - If uncertain → Present top 3-5 differential diagnoses ranked by likelihood
3. For each potential diagnosis, note:
   - Supporting evidence from interview
   - Supporting evidence from research
   - Distinguishing features
   - Tests that would confirm/rule out
4. Append differential to \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\`

**After completing differential:**
- Announce: "Differential complete. Moving to PHASE 4: TREATMENT PLAN"

---

### PHASE 4: TREATMENT PLAN

**Instructions:**
1. Based on diagnosis/differential, develop treatment plan
2. Include:
   - Prioritized treatment steps
   - Urgency levels (immediate, short-term, long-term)
   - Specific specialist referrals if needed
   - Tests to request
   - Follow-up schedule
3. Keep recommendations diagnosis-specific (no general wellness filler)
4. Append treatment plan to \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\`

**After completing treatment plan:**
- Announce: "Treatment plan complete. Moving to PHASE 5: REPORT GENERATION"

---

### PHASE 5: REPORT GENERATION

**Instructions:**
1. Write comprehensive SOAP report to \`$REPORT_PATH\`:

\`\`\`markdown
# Patient Report: $PATIENT_NAME
## Date: [Current Date]

## Executive Summary
[2-3 paragraph overview of findings and recommendations]

---

## Subjective
[Patient's reported symptoms and history from interview]

## Objective
[Relevant findings from file analysis, research citations]

## Assessment
[Diagnosis or differential with confidence levels]
[Inline citations to supporting research]

## Plan
[Structured treatment plan with urgency levels]
[Follow-up schedule]
[Recommended tests/referrals]

---

## Detailed Findings

### Interview Responses
[Full interview Q&A]

### Research Analysis
[Key research findings with citations]

### Differential Reasoning
[How each diagnosis was considered/ruled out]

## References
[All sources cited]

---

\`\`\`

2. After writing report, output: \`<promise>$COMPLETION_PROMISE</promise>\`

---

## Running Notes Format

Maintain \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\` with this structure:

\`\`\`markdown
# Patient: $PATIENT_NAME

## Session: [Date/Time]

### Chief Complaint
[Symptoms]

### Interview Findings
[Detailed Q&A responses]

### Research Notes
[Key findings with citations]

### Differential
[Working diagnosis/differential]

### Treatment Plan
[Current recommendations]

---
[Previous sessions below, most recent first]
\`\`\`

---

## Begin Phase 1: Interview

$(if [[ -n "$EXISTING_NOTES" ]]; then echo "**NOTE:** Existing patient notes found at \`$PATIENT_NOTES_PATH\`. Read them first to understand history before beginning interview."; else echo "**NOTE:** This is a new patient. No previous notes exist."; fi)

**START WITH STEP 1:** First, ask the patient about any medical records they want to share (using AskUserQuestion). Process any files ONE BY ONE, checking sizes before reading. Then proceed to the symptom interview.
